# r-syst::fungi
Curated repository of releases of r-syst reference database for fungi (fasta and taxonomy file for several amplified regions)   

**Contact:**  Val√©rie Laval, valerie.laval@inra.fr


## Barcodes

The barcode regions are:
* EF1alpha
* ITS (Internal Transcribed Spacer)
* RPB2

## Amplified regions



The amplified regions are
* EF1alpha and EF1alphalong for EF1alpha
* ITS1-ITS2 for ITS
* RPB2


## Projects

The projects which have supported the construction of the databases are  
* Lycovitis
* Mycotek

## Types of files

There is one set of datasets per amplified region.   

The datasets for each amplified region are available as two files:
* a fasta file (with suffix .fas)
* a character file (with suffix .char)

For each amplified region, the character file s an exel file containing the sequence id of the fasta file and their corresponding taxonomic ranks. The exel file is a tab as separators within a row. 
Each column corresponds to a taxonomic rank, as follows:   
* Order
* Family
* Genus
* Species
